# cinema_pre_show_generator

@yasoob code in his book Practical Python Projects Chapter 7 is not working anymore. So wrote a newer version. You can run the code in your terminal like this:

python app.py "The Movie Name"

And it will generate a preshow with related upcoming movie trailers. You will need to generate an api key at [tmdb](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and assign it to tmdb.API_KEY for the code to work.
